                <div class="overview">In 2000, Northern Territory exhibited the highest CO2 emissions per capita, followed closely by Western Australia.
                    By 2020, while Northern Territory continued to be at the forefront, there was a noticeable shift in the emission patterns of other states. Queensland, for instance, saw an upward trend, whereas states like Victoria maintained a relatively consistent emission rate.

                <div class="overview">Over the three-decade span, Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory, and Western Australia witnessed peaks and troughs but remained consistently high in their emission rates.
                    The introduction of the 'Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act' in 2000 and the 'Clean Energy Act' in 2011 marked significant policy changes, which can be correlated with fluctuations in the emission trends of certain states.
                    States like Tasmania maintained a steady, low emission rate throughout the years, showcasing the effectiveness of sustainable practices.
                    It's evident from the data that while some regions have made commendable efforts in reducing their carbon footprint, others still have a long way to go. As Australia continues its journey towards sustainability, these insights can be instrumental in shaping future environmental policies and strategies.
